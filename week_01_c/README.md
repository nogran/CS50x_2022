# Week 01 - Types, format codes, operators, variables, functions, loops and conditionals
I've learned the syntax, rules around structure, punctuation, and symbols in code.

## Types:
- bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false;
- char, a single character like a or 2;
- double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float;
- float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value;
- int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits;
- long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int;
- string, a string of characters.

## CS50 Library has corresponding functions to get input of various types:
- `get_char`
	- [agree.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/agree.c)
- `get_double`
- `get_float`
	- [pennies.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/pennies.c)
- `get_int`
	- [points.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/points.c)
- `get_long`
- `get_string`
	- [hello.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/hello.c)

## For printf, too, there are different placeholders for each type, called format codes:
- `%c` for chars;
- `%f` for floats or doubles;
- `%i` for ints;
- `%li` for long integers;
- `%s` for strings.

## Operators:
- `+` for addition;
- `-` for subtraction;
- `*` for multiplication;
	- [calculator.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/calculator.c)
- `/` for division;
	- [discount.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/discount.c)
- `%` for remainder
	- [paraty.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/parity.c)

## Loops, functions - Variables, syntactic sugar:
	- [mario.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/mario.c)
	- [meow_while.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/meow_while.c)
	- [meow_for.c](https://github.com/nogran/CS50x_2022/blob/main/week_01_c/meow_for.c)
