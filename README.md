# CS50x_2022

This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience.

I'm also using Norminette from 42School. It's a usefull tool to write a code following the norm.
